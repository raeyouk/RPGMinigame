# RPGMinigame

I decided to create this short game as my final project during a summer coding camp when I was in middle school. This was my first-ever experience with programming, so it's not really advanced and doesn't really follow coding best practices...

I do like my ASCII art, though.

Feel free to download <a href="https://github.com/raeyouk/RPGMinigame/raw/master/RPGMiniGame.exe" download>RPGMinigame.exe</a> to quickly give it a try!
